# ASLR-Cache-MMU

In the *proposal* directory, I have added three different proposals for course project. 

Proposal 0: Side-channel Attack on Cache and MMU. 

Proposal 1: Smart Backup Using Link

Proposal 2: Cache Replacement Policy and Bélády's anomaly

Personally, Proposal 0 is too challenging, and the link between Proposal 2 and operating systems is not so solid, although they are more interesting. Proposal 1 therefore is, seemingly, the most suitable. 

Thanks for important guides provided by Prof. Shu Yin. I find it rewarding to write such a proposal, and I hope to work for one or more of them in the future even if it is not appropriate for this summer.
